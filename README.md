## Features

- **Classic Gameplay**: Enjoy the traditional Minesweeper experience.
- **AI Integration**: An intelligent agent that uses first-order logic for decision-making.
- **Interactive UI**: A user-friendly interface built with Pygame.
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust difficulty levels and game settings.
- **Open Source**: Contribute to the project and improve the AI.

## Installation

To get started with the Minesweeper AI, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rathu2306/minesweeper.git
   cd minesweeper
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Make sure you have Python and Pygame installed. You can install Pygame using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

3. **Run the Game**:

   Execute the game with the following command:

   ```bash
   python minesweeper.py
   ```

## Usage

After running the game, you will see the Minesweeper grid. Click on the cells to reveal them. The AI agent will make moves based on its knowledge base and inference rules. You can watch it strategize and uncover the mines.

## AI Agent

The AI agent in this project utilizes knowledge representation and first-order logic to analyze the game state. Hereâ€™s how it works:

- **Knowledge Base**: The agent maintains a knowledge base that stores information about revealed cells, potential mine locations, and safe moves.
- **Inference Engine**: The agent applies inference rules to deduce new information from its knowledge base.
- **Decision Making**: The agent chooses moves based on the safest options available, minimizing the risk of hitting a mine.

### How the AI Works

1. **Initial State**: The agent starts with no information and updates its knowledge base as cells are revealed.
2. **Inference**: It uses logical reasoning to make deductions about the location of mines.
3. **Move Selection**: The agent selects the next cell to reveal based on its analysis.

## Game Rules

The rules of Minesweeper are simple yet challenging:

- The objective is to clear a grid without hitting mines.
- Clicking on a cell reveals either a number (indicating adjacent mines) or a mine (resulting in game over).
- The player can flag cells they suspect contain mines.
